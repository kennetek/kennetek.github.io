Hello, I am a robotics engineer from Arizona. I have been the captain of VEXU team PYRO for four years. I am passionate about building machines, manufacturing, and CAD modelling. My proficiencies include mechanical, electrical, and pneumatic systems, as well as some programming. 

This site acts as a portfolio/blog for the engineering projects I am working on. The projects I am most proud of are my final VEX robot, Revolver, and my CNC mill. There are other manufacturing projects I have worked on, but they are protected by NDA.
