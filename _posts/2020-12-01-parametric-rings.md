## About
The main CAD suite used to do CAD and CAM for jewelry is Matrix, which is a dressed-up version of Rhino with added programs meant specifically for making jewelry. Rhino is not a parametric CAD software, and after many requests to make a very similar ring design, I decided to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing process by creating a script (VBScript) inside Rhino to automate as much of the process as possible. This cut down significantly on design time and saved the company[^jmd] money.
