## Description
Gridfinity is an open-source standard for making 3D printed part organizers created by Zack Freedman.[^zack] Given its relatively limited scope, I had decided to implement the models into OpenSCAD, a lightweight and open-source CAD modelling program that uses code to produce 3D meshes. I felt OpenSCAD was perfect for this problem over more advanced CAD suites, as OpenSCAD is accessible to most users and is ideal for making models for additive manufacturing. OpenSCAD also will not struggle under the high possible variety of bins and different custom geometry while programs like Fusion 360 or Solidworks will struggle with missing geometry or features. Take a look at the Github,[^github] the Printables page,[^printables] or the documentation[^docs] for more information about the scripts. The project has grown far past what I had initially anticipated, with a thriving community of contributors always looking to make even more types of bins as the project evolves.
