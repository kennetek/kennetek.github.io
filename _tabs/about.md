I am an engineer from Arizona with a bachelor's degree in robotics from Arizona State University. I have been the captain of VEXU team PYRO for four years. The things I am most passionate about are building machines, manufacturing, and CAD modelling. My proficiencies include mechanical, electrical, and pneumatic systems, as well as some programming, and am currently looking for a job in a manufacturing related field in the Scottsdale area. 

This site acts as a portfolio for the engineering projects I am working on.
