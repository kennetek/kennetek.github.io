I built a machine to help a research lab at ASU Tempe meet a strict project deadline. There was little time remaining until this deadline, and they had to produce a large quantity of a consumable, which had currently been made individually by a skilled operator using hand tools. I quickly built a device (with mechanical, electrical, and pneumatic subsystems) within their time frame to semi-automate this process, allowing for 10 operations to be done simultaneously. This reduced the amount of setup required, removed the need for a highly skilled operator, and improved the consistency of the output. The overall time to produce a final unit was reduced by 90%. This machine helped the research team meet their deliverable deadline, which allowed them to earn another sizable grant for their research.
